## 📋 What is ValveResourceFormat?

ValveResourceFormat is a desktop application that lets you open and explore files used in Source 2 games made by Valve, such as the newer versions of games like Dota 2 or Half-Life: Alyx.  

With this tool, you can browse VPK archives—special collections of game files—view and extract different game assets like maps, models, materials, textures, and sounds. You can also decompile these assets, which means breaking them down into formats that are easier to understand or reuse.

This application works with files that are usually hidden deep inside game folders, giving you easy access in one place without needing any special coding skills.
